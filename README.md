# chat-app-reactnative

When running a React Native app that uses Socket.io for real-time communication, the connection often fails on mobile devices if the backend server is hosted on localhost or a local IP address (e.g., 192.168.x.x).

This is because mobile devices cannot directly access local development servers running on a PC or laptop unless both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network and configured properly.

However, in my case, the setup works perfectly on my local system â€” both the mobile and the server are on the same network, and communication is smooth.
The issue may only appear when the app is built into an APK or used outside the local development environment.
